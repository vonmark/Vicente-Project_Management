human errors and will also consume a lot of time, the way of gathering datas are also difficult, because not only you have to copy the 
information manually, since its tangiable these records can be lost, destroyed or not understandable because of ugly handwriting  and will 
take a lot of time, but most of all, you have to make sure that the source is secured or in other words, trustworthy. That is a major need 
for a business, having a partner in business are a huge factor in managing not only
